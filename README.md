# BetterConsole.NET
BetterConsole is a .NET package that allows you to easily use colors and other cool things in the console that hopefully make your life just a little bit easier.

To use BetterConsole instead of System.Console, add `using Console = BetterConsole.Console;` to the top of your file.
